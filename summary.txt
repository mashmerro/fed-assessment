Description: Assessment Summary

1. For faster page speed:
    - To compress files as much as possible, I used an App called Prepros to minify...
        + CSS & JS file
        + Optimized larger image files
    - To fetch font files faster, I included...
        + <link rel="preload" as="font">
    - When using the font-awesome library, I used a CDN, which is group of server to shorten the distance of travel between the server and the user.
    - Declared the DOCTYPE so that it lets the browser know to use HTML5 and makes sure it is parsed the same way in different web browsers.

2. To improve SEO:
    - Made the web page load faster
    - Added meta tags such as viewports, descriptions, and keywords
    - For search engine to index the webpage, I removed...
        <meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow"/>
    - Accessability by adding 'alt' attributes on every img tags

3. Interactive pieces & additional components:
    - Automatic slideshow with manual dot indicators
    - Hovering on Featured products highlights the product 
    - Hamburger menu toggles footer header titles
    - Accordion on the footer headers
    - Added a favicon for browser tabs closely related to the website which was downloaded from google images
    - Clickable phone and email under 'Contact Us' will allow the users to call and email directly

Font: 
    - Utilized the Google Font API by embedding the respective fonts in the head element since Allura and Alex Brush are not part of the default HTML fonts.
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Allura&display=swap"/>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Alex+Brush&family=Allura&display=swap"/>

Site Logos: 
    - To account for retina screens, instead of using the .png format for the site logos, I changed its image tags to the .svg image files that was included in the 'images' folder.
      This way, even when it is zoomed in, it won't lose its resolution.
        <img src="images/bb-logo.svg" alt="Beautiful Beginnings: Celebrating baby and child">

Icons:
    - To add the icons, I utilized the font-awesome library and included its 4.7 CDN version so that it is more compatible with older browsers.
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css"/>
    - Additional icons that I've added are for:
        + Baby Registry, Login/ Register, Check out cart, and Search icon by the top header
        + Address, Phone, Email, Clock under the 'Contact Us' section
    - Top Header Mobile:
        + For the shopping cart, instead of using the font-awesome library for icons, I used the .svg files under the 'images' folder.
        + Same process with the hamburger menu, but since there was no asset provided, I downloaded a free 'menu-toggle.svg' file from 'icomoon.io' (same source as the 'shopping-cart.svg') and matched its size with the shopping cart.

Navigation:
    - To open up the bottom footer areas (such as the About, Service, Shop, and Contact) through the hamburger menu toggle in smaller devices, I added an HTML list, styled it through CSS, and added a JS functionality so that when the hamburger menu is toggled, the dropdown will show up.

Slideshow:
    - Since there was no additional image slides from the 'images' folder, I downloaded some images from Google and scaled it similar to the default image. Three images is usually a good minimum to showcase different products for the slideshow.
    - Some CSS styles that I added/ improved (some included from the PSD files) are:
        + Border outline inside the slideshow image
        + White background with linear opacity gradient for the slide content
        + For responsiveness and better viewing, I hid the slideshow on viewports less than 900px.
        + Fixed the right black border on the slides when shrinking the viewport.
    - I set up the slide functionality in 'main.js' and I figured it would be best to have it on an automatic slideshow, rotating every 5 seconds.
        + Additionally, I've included the dot indicators to show the current slide. You can also manually switch between slides through the dot indicators.

Footer:
    - Responsive styles for the footer includes:
        + Footer top headers turns into an accordion.
        + The rest of the footer becomes vertically centered.
    - Changed the social media links to image logos that were included in the 'images' folder. Styled it up to line horizontally and spaced out.
    - Included the accordion functionality in the js file. When the user clicks the header or '+' sign, it will maximize the content and show the sub-menu. Vice versa with '-' will minimize the content.
    - Fixed the bottom footer copyright and site logo on the desktop viewport but could not fix it on smaller viewports.

Responsive:
    - Fixed the site to switch to mobile styles by including the meta viewport in the head tag.
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"/>
    - Removed the scrollbar in smaller screens with CSS styles.
    - Did not get to add anything in the tablet portrait mode.


Future Improvements:
    - Adding more content to the tablet mode and adjusting the bottom footer on smaller viewports
    - Allura and Alex Brush are in cursive so some users might not be able to read it
    - Even though the website is catered for families or moms, font should not be too sophisticated since it's a website for babies
    - Grid table for featured products
    - More modern animation such as hamburger menu toggle 
    - Full sized content that takes up the whole page similar to modern websites instead of a page wrap 
    - Utilize more of the website's pastel color scheme such as blue, green, and yellow
