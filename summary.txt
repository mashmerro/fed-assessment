Description: Assessment Summary

1. Declared the DOCTYPE so that it lets the browser know to use HTML5 and makes sure it is parsed the same way in different web browsers.
2. Added meta viewports for responsive design to look good on all devices
3. Added meta descriptions and keywords for improved SEO.

Font: 
    - Since Allura and Alex Brush are not part of the default HTML fonts, I utilized the Google Font API by embedding the respective fonts in the head element.
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Allura&display=swap"/>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Alex+Brush&family=Allura&display=swap"/>

Site Logos: 
    - To account for retina screens, instead of using the .png format for the site logos, I changed its image tags to the .svg image files that was included in the 'images' folder.
      This way, even when it is zoomed in, it won't lose its resolution.
        <img src="images/bb-logo.svg" alt="Beautiful Beginnings: Celebrating baby and child">

Icons:
    - To add the icons, I utilized the font-awesome library and included its 4.7 CDN version so that it is more compatible with older browsers.
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css"/>
    - Additional icons that I've added are for:
        + Baby Registry, Login/ Register, Check out cart, and Search icon by the top header
        + Address, Phone, Email, Clock under the 'Contact Us' section
    - Top Header Mobile:
        + For the shopping cart, instead of using the font-awesome library for icons, I used the .svg files under the 'images' folder.
        + Same process with the hamburger menu, but since there was no asset provided, I downloaded a free 'menu-toggle.svg' file from 'icomoon.io' (same source as the 'shopping-cart.svg') and matched its size with the shopping cart.

Navigation:
    - To open up the bottom footer areas (such as the About, Service, Shop, and Contact) through the hamburger menu toggle in smaller devices, I added an HTML list, styled it through CSS, and added a JS functionality so that when the hamburger menu is toggled, the dropdown will show up.

Slideshow:
    - Since there was no additional slides from the 'images' folder to use for the slider function, I downloaded some images from Google and scaled it similar to the default image. Three images is usually a good minimum to showcase for the slideshow.
    - Some CSS styles that I added/ improved (some included from the PSD files) are:
        + Border outline inside the slideshow image
        + White background with linear opacity gradient for the slide content
        + For responsiveness and better viewing, I hid the slideshow on viewports less than 900px.
        + Fixed the right black border on the slides when shrinking the viewport.
    - I set up the slide functionality in 'main.js' and I figured it would be best to have it on an automatic slideshow, changing every 5 seconds.
        + Additionally, I've included the dot indicators to show the current slide. It has pink indicators that complements the website's design. You can also manually switch between slides through the dot indicators.

Footer:
    - 
    - Changed the social media links to logos that were included in the 'images' folder. Styled it up to line horizontally and spaced out.
    - I've included the accordion functionality in the js file. When the user clicks the header or '+' sign, it will maximize the content. Vice versa with '-' will minimize the content.
    - Fixed the bottom footer on the desktop viewport but could not fix it on smaller viewports.

Responsive:
    - 

Not in the scope but added:
    - Added a favicon for browser tabs closely related to the website which was downloaded from google images.
    - Hovering over featured products will highlight it with pink as an accent color
